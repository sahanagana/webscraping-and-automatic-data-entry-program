## research

For this project, I had to learn a lot about using python to affect website html. I chose to research the Selenuim tool and how it uses html attributes such as id or class to identify components on the website. I also found out it used a webdriver to open the browser and input data on its own, so I had to find documentation as to how to install and use that webdriver.  
A main challenge was finding a website that allowed bruteforcing. After some research I found that many Software companies set up websites and web applications for beginners to test programs on. I found a website created by IBM (https://demo.testfire.net/) with a login page that allowed me to input values as needed.  
The main problem with my program was that it can take some time to load the webdriver and start inputting values.  
However, the website was created for SQL injection testing and not login testing, so I didn't know the login details of the site to prove that it worked if it had the correct values. Thus, I had to rewrite the code with a site that I knew the credentials for (https://requestswebsite.notanothercoder.repl.co/), hence the multiple files containing pretty much the same thing.
